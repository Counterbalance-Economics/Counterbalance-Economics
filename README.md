### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

The impacts of income inequality can be seen everywhere, regardless of
the country or the level of economic development. According to the
literature review, income inequality has negative impacts in economic,
social, and political variables. Notwithstanding of how well or not
countries have done in reducing income inequality, none have been able
to reduce it to a Gini Coefficient level of 0.2 or less.
This is the promise that a novel approach called Counterbalance
Economics (CBE) provides without the need of increased taxes. The
research has shown that introducing the CBE will provide a range of
benefits to society including reduce Income inequality to almost zero,
reduce government expenditure by around one third, reduce crime, and
mitigate a range of social issues, such as unemployment, housing,
poverty, and the job displacement that automation and artificial
intelligence are set to bring.
Based on the computer simulation run on NetLogo, if the Counterbalance
Economics model was introduced into the Australian, UK, US, Swiss or
German economies, between 2006 and 2018, these economies would
have increased their overall GDP by around 4 per cent and reduced their
level of inequality from an average of 0.33 down to 0.08.
